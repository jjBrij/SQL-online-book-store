# üìö Online Book Store - SQL Project

This project simulates an **Online Book Store** using SQL. It involves querying data from three CSV files that represent different entities in a bookstore: Books, Customers, and Orders.

## üìÅ Dataset

The project uses **3 CSV files**:

- `Books.csv`
- `Customers.csv`
- `Orders.csv`

These files are interrelated using common columns such as `Book_ID` and `Customer_ID`.

## üßæ Table Schema Assumption

| Table      | Key Columns                      |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| Books      | `Book_ID`, `Genre`, `Stock`, `Price`, `Author`, `Year_Published` |
| Customers  | `Customer_ID`, `Name`, `Country`, `City` |
| Orders     | `Order_ID`, `Book_ID`, `Customer_ID`, `Quantity`, `Order_Date`, `Total_Amount` |

> Ensure the column names and data types are consistent across tables (especially for `Customer_ID` and `Book_ID`).
